# Idea

Don't you wish there was a place you could go to share your great boardgame ideas and help your friends with their boardgame ideas?

Check it! RoundTable is a free online collection of board game ideas. Members are able to submit ideas for new board games and users are able to view submitted board game ideas as well as edit any existing ideas. Have images you need to add so everyone can get a better idea of how your game works? No worries! RoundTable 1.0 now supports images!

# Technologies

This project allowed us to become more familiar with the Rails framework and using Continuous Integration in the workflow (Travis CI). It also gave us the chance to incorporate new gems we haven't used like devise and paperclip.
